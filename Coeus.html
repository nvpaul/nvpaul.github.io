					Coeus is a voice skill designed for the Amazon Alexa platform. The skill aims to education users about health and wellness through gamification.
					Specifically, Coeus is a multiple choice quiz that asks the user a total of three questions. After guessing, Coeus provides the user with the correct answer and either a related fact or more detailed information.
					<br><br>
					Follow along with my design thinking process to learn more about what Coeus is, why Coeus was created, and how Coeus was developed.

				<p class="DefineDescription">
					The life expectancy (LE) and health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) in Canada have been increasing consistently over the past decade, however,
					two-thirds of Canadian adults live with at least one modifiable risk factor for chronic disease, including:
				</p>
				<ul class="DefineDescription noBullet">
					<li>Tobacco smoking</li>
					<li>Physical inactivity</li>
					<li>Sedentary behaviour</li>
					<li>Unhealthy eating</li>
					<li>Harmful use of alcohol</li>
					<li>Obesity</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="DefineDescription">
					There are many tools and resources on the existing web and mobile platforms designed to help individuals live healthier lives, however, the new 
					voice platform (Amazon Alexa and Google Home) are increasing in popularity, especially among younger generations, and have the potential to deliver 
					information regarding health and wellness to users hands-free, easily fitting into their busy schedules.
					<br><br>

					Some of Canada's stats regarding use of the voice platform are as follows:
					<br><span class="stat">26%</span> of Canadians are using the voice platform as of 2020.
					<br><span class="stat">1/5</span> Canadian internet users use smart speakers at least once a month as of 2019, with an expected growth of <span class="stat">15%</span> by 2020.
					<br><br>
					<span class="emphasis">
					With the voice platform becoming increasingly popular among Canadian's, it is increasingly common to use voice searches to convey information to users.
					We could use a voice skill to help teach Canadians about health and wellness and encourage healthy lifestyles, hopefully preventing users from 
					falling into the categories of modifiable risk factors listed above.
