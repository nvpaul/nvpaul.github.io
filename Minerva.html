				<p class="DefineDescription">
					The life expectancy (LE) and health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) in Canada have been increasing consistently over the past decade, however,
					two-thirds of Canadian adults live with at least one modifiable risk factor for chronic disease, including:
				</p>
				<ul class="DefineDescription noBullet">
					<li>Tobacco smoking</li>
					<li>Physical inactivity</li>
					<li>Sedentary behaviour</li>
					<li>Unhealthy eating</li>
					<li>Harmful use of alcohol</li>
					<li>Obesity</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="DefineDescription">
					In fact, Canada ranks among the worst of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries for adult obesity rates.
					Although there has been a major decrease in mortality in Canada, the overall burden of disease is increasing. 
					<br><br>
					<span class="emphasis">Canadians are living longer, but it would be best if we lived longer in good health.</span>
					<br><br>
					Some of Canada's reported areas of concern stem from the following stats:
					<br><span class="stat">1 in 6</span> Canadians are 65 years or older, with this population growing <span class="stat">4 times</span> faster than the overall population.
					<br><span class="stat">1 in 5</span> Canadian adults live with a chronic disease.
					<br><span class="stat">2 in 3</span> Canadian adult deaths are caused by major chronic diseases.
					<br><span class="stat">2 in 3</span> Canadian adults live with a <span class="emphasis">modifiable</span> risk factor for chronic disease.
					<br><br>
					<span class="emphasis">These risk factors that place the health of Canadian adults in danger are modifiable. With individual, community, and population interventions,
					we could help lower these stats and help Canadians live healthier lives. Minerva strives to accomplish this task through individual education.</span>
